# Two Implementations of Mark Fischlin's Paper
This paper was called Round-Optimal Composable Blind Signatures in the Common Reference String Model.
The CRS implementation is closer to the method shown in the paper.
While, The Fiat-Shamir version provides an alternative method.
Both can be used however it is yet to be determined which is betetr suited for real world large scale implementation with current computational power and hardware availability.
